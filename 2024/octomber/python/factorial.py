# Create a program that receives a non-negative integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. By definition, the factorial of 0 is 1.

def factorial(n):
    result = 0
    for i in range(n):
        return n * result
    
    return result
